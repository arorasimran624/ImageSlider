This is my project named "IMAGE SLIDER'

This is made with the help of HTML,CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) and Javascript.

Firstly,the html file contains the division of images,buttons,etc.
Then,it have a CSS file for styling and decoration.
And,it hava a javascript file for its working

Firstly,when you will open the project,you will see a image slider and 
images are in automatic slideshow and you will get the position on 
which image you are by seeing the dots below it.And you can also use navigation
buttons(previous and next) for sliding images according to you.

The transition applied will give user smooth and intuitive experience and
animation is pleasing.Images are in loop so you can see images from both sides.

Automatic Slider will slide the image in 2s if you didnot slide it with buttons.
If mouse is over slider,then automatic slideshow will not work.

Image Slider is responsive on all screens.

In this way,you can use this IMAGE SLIDER.
